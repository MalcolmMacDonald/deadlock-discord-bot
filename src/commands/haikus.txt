This is a known thing,

Found day one of hero labs

Actually lol



Punching strangers with

No reaction doesnt feel

So good now, does it?



Looks about right for

The lobbies suseptible to

A Geist melee build



Why does mirage look

Like brazilian emperor

Dom Pedro the first



The people asking

For tbagging to be bannable

Is hilarious



I am at the urn

altar and about to take

it across the map!



Your graphics card is

Too slow to play the game, it

Appears. I'm sorry



Dont think it does much,

Movement in deadlock carries

Too much momentum



Deathy, Schizug, and MarcoStyle

Are the most informative

And straight to the point



I'm a new player

In deadlock, why was the pulse

Considered trolling?



Viscous shoots a small

Aoe ball that explodes on hit

Or certain distance



God I hope abrams

Use this build, make fighting him

So much easier



Please do Pocket, they

Are severely lacking high

Quality fan art



I think its evil

And abhorrent which is why

I always do it



You go on twitch, put

It in your description and

You are top mmr, ez



I know the game is

In alpha but this feels more

Like beta to me



Hmm I'm not against

It but I don't see any

Reason to add it



Mine got turned off with

The new update. I just had

To turn it back on



I want a zipline

Cosmetic in game that makes

Me fly like dead weight



With noting that they

Take damage from getting knocked

Off the zipline too



Yall my maid look a

Lil different but i cant

Quite figure it out



Yeah, suddenly can

Only log in on web. had

Just finished a match



I really like it.

Hope they just let us costmize

It to our liking



I don't even know what

Dota does. Is it like league with

A ban pick system?



Mr fruit is a good

Watch, relatable funny

Gameplay with some tips



Anything that's not

The current massive fucking

Forehead is ok



Not even King Arthur

Will be able to pull me

Out of the Ivyussy



Those posters are in

The training zone on the wall,

Right next to the shop



I will join but my

Next move is returning to

The unfinished camp



As a shiv main, I

Am so pissed that I didn't

Think of this sooner



Viscous one might be

One of the easiest one,

A group fight then done



It's a visual

Representation of the

Lane situation



New one is so much

Better, thank God we got a

New art direction



Idk but I

Hope you aren't crazy because

That's hilarious



I stopped playing and

The game is back to running

Normally this patch



Besides nerfing her

Damage too, I don't know what

Valve is thinking lol



What? Why did they do

That? Is there no option to

Change it in keybinds?



Yeah, they don't want you

To get a free kill every

Time it' on cooldown



SMNC gets brought up in

Every thread about this game

So i would say yes
